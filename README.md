Problem Definition and Objectives
Problem Definition:
Our business is currently grappling with two critical challenges:
1.	Declining Profit Margins: While sales volumes have remained stable or even increased, certain product categories are generating losses. This has resulted in overall shrinking profit margins, which are becoming unsustainable for the business in the long term.
2.	Customer Attrition: There is a noticeable decline in customer retention, particularly in high-value segments. This trend has been especially evident among Consumer segment customers, who contribute significantly to the business’s profitability. As these customers disengage, it poses a significant risk to revenue generation and long-term customer loyalty.
Our goal is to analyze the data to uncover actionable insights that will help address these issues, focusing on identifying the root causes behind these trends and providing a roadmap to improve both profit margins and customer retention.
Objectives:
•	Identify the key factors contributing to declining profit margins, especially focusing on underperforming product categories.
•	Understand the drivers behind customer attrition, with a special focus on high-value segments, and identify potential gaps in customer experience.
•	Provide data-driven solutions to optimize pricing, discount strategies, and improve customer retention programs.
•	Offer recommendations to streamline logistics and shipping methods to improve both customer satisfaction and profitability.

Description of the Datasets Used and Their Relevance
1. Transaction Data:
•	Features: Includes columns such as Product, Region, Discount Band, Units Sold, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Profit, and others.
•	Relevance: This dataset is central to the analysis as it contains key information on sales performance, pricing, and profitability. By examining these columns, we can identify product categories that are underperforming or operating at a loss, despite high sales volumes. This data also helps us analyze how discounts and sales strategies impact profit margins over time.
2. Customer Demographics Data:
•	Features: This dataset includes customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate), their purchase history, and other demographic details.
•	Relevance: Customer segmentation is crucial for understanding which groups are driving the majority of profits and where attrition is most pronounced. By tracking customer behavior and purchase history, we can identify patterns that may signal potential churn, particularly among high-value customers, and tailor retention strategies accordingly.
3. External Data:
•	Public Holiday Dataset: Includes data on national and regional holidays, gathered via web scraping.
o	Relevance: Holidays significantly affect purchasing behavior. By analyzing the sales trends during holidays versus non-holidays, we can gauge how external events impact sales volumes and customer behavior. This data is essential to understand seasonality and its effect on customer demand.
•	Temperature Data: Compiled from weather sources through scraping.
o	Relevance: External temperature variations can influence the demand for certain products (e.g., outdoor furniture in warmer months). By incorporating weather patterns into the analysis, we can assess whether weather conditions are driving or hindering sales of particular product categories.
4. Shipping and Logistics Data:
•	Features: Includes shipping method types (e.g., Standard, Expedited), delivery timeframes, and associated shipping costs.
•	Relevance: Shipping methods are directly tied to customer satisfaction. If customers in high-value segments are receiving delayed shipments, this could contribute to churn. Furthermore, logistics data can help us understand cost inefficiencies in the supply chain, particularly for low-margin products like Bookcases and Supplies.

Summary of the Key Findings and Recommendations
Key Findings:
1.	Profit Margins:
o	Certain product categories, such as Bookcases and Supplies, are operating at a loss despite having strong sales. The losses from these categories are eroding profits from high-performing categories such as Copiers and Phones.
o	Heavy discounting strategies have contributed to short-term sales spikes but have not translated into sustained profitability, indicating that discounting may be inefficient.
2.	Customer Attrition:
o	The Consumer segment, which contributes nearly 47% of total profits, shows significant churn, with key customers like Raymond Buch ceasing their purchases in 2016.
o	The decline in repeat purchases among high-value customers suggests potential dissatisfaction with the product offerings, pricing, or customer service.
3.	Shipping and Logistics:
o	The analysis of shipping methods reveals that Standard Class shipping, while dominating, might frustrate high-value customers who expect faster delivery. Additionally, products like Bookcases may be incurring higher logistics costs, further eroding profitability.

Recommendations:
1.	Restructure Underperforming Product Lines:
o	Discontinue or rebrand loss-making categories like Bookcases and Supplies. Consider bundling these products with higher-margin items such as Copiers to offset the losses.
o	Evaluate pricing strategies for these products, potentially revising them to align better with market demand and costs.
2.	Enhance Customer Retention Efforts:
o	Focus on loyalty programs for the Consumer segment, which has the highest revenue contribution. Target these high-value customers with personalized offers, rewards, and engagement campaigns to reduce churn.
o	Conduct customer feedback surveys or analyze customer interactions to pinpoint specific pain points that may be causing attrition (e.g., poor service, delayed shipments, or dissatisfaction with pricing).
3.	Optimize Shipping and Logistics:
o	Offer expedited shipping options for high-value customers, especially those in the Consumer segment, to improve satisfaction and reduce churn due to slow deliveries.
o	Audit shipping costs for loss-making categories to identify potential inefficiencies. Renegotiate supplier contracts or explore more cost-effective shipping methods for low-margin products.
4.	Refine Discount Strategies:
o	Reassess the current discounting strategy, focusing on balancing short-term sales with long-term profitability. Implement smarter discounting approaches that prioritize customer retention and profitability over sheer volume.
Conclusion:
By implementing these targeted recommendations, we can significantly address the core issues of declining profit margins and customer attrition. Restructuring underperforming product lines and optimizing pricing will help restore profitability, while strengthening customer retention efforts, particularly within the Consumer segment, will safeguard revenue from our highest-value customers. Furthermore, optimizing logistics and refining our discount strategies will not only enhance customer satisfaction but also improve our operational efficiency. These data-driven strategies will empower the business to transform challenges into growth opportunities, ensuring long-term success and a more sustainable competitive position in the market.
